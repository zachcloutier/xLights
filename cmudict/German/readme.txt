This folder is used to prepare the ../bin/standard_dictionary file from the CMU SPhinx download

CMU Dict information can be found:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/

Download the cmusphinx-voxforge-de.dic file

Rename it cmudict.dict

Update if necessary the Phoneme mapping file "map"

Run the CMUDict_Tool to create a standard_dictionary which represents this german dictionary. These can then be manually added by users.
