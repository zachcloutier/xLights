        <h1>Custom model remapping</h1>
        <p>We have all been there. Pushing pixels into a coro prop only to find dozens or even hundreds of pixels into it that we made some stupid error and now nothing matches to that carefully curated custom model you downloaded including all those wonderful face definitions, states and submodels. Or maybe you have downloaded the vendor model and all those things are there but you think you can wire it in a more efficient way and avoid a bunch of cutting and splicing pixels ... but the mere thought of having to sort out all those submodels, faces and states makes you go weak at the knees.</p>
        <p>The custom model remapping tool in the Tools menu is for you. It takes in 2 xmodel files with the same model at the same resolution with pixels in all the same locations ... just which number pixel in some or even all of the locations is different. One of those models is likely the vendors model with all its perfect faces, states and submodels ... lets call this the original model. The other is yours with the revised wiring layout and the broken faces/states/submodels or maybe none of them at all.</p>
        <p>Just select the two files and if they validate ok press the generate button and a new xmodel file will be created which can then import into your layout. It will have all the faces/states/submodels the vendor model had except with your wiring layout.</p>
        <p>Note any submodels etc you may have in the new model will be destroyed by this process.</p>
