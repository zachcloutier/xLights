        <h1>Show Directory Structure</h1>
        <p>While there are lots of ways you can structure your folders I believe there are better and worse ways. It does somewhat depend on your requirements. I am going to assume you want to keep your folders separate year to year. I also am going to assume you want to keep holidays separate (although you don’t have to if previews provide you with enough).</p>
        <p>I am also going to assume you are keeping it in your home documents folder on windows ... although this will vary based on OS and again this is not critical.</p>
        <p>So my home folder for Christmas would be: C:\Users\&lt;you&gt;\Documents\xLights\2022\Christmas</p>
        <p>Halloween would be: C:\Users\&lt;you&gt;\Documents\xLights\2022\Halloween</p>
        <p>By keeping the year out of the actual show folder name we let xLights sort out the path issues when we move it between machines.</p>
        <p>Inside my show folder I would create folders for key assets.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Audio - all my music goes here - I would also put videos here I am using for their audio</li>
            <li>Video - any effect video I use goes here</li>
            <li>Images - any image files I use goes here</li>
            <li>Import\<vendor>\<sequence> - All my imports go here ... that way any images etc I use from them are nicely inside my show folder and don’t break</li>
            <li>Palettes - when I save palettes I put them here</li>
            <li>valuecurves - when I export value curves they go here</li>
            <li>Colorcurves - when I export color curves they go here</li>
            <li>Shaders - shaders I download go here</li>
            <li>DownloadedFaces - face images I download fo here</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may or may not want to have "Backup" and "Render Cache" in your show folder. I definitely would use preferences to move it somewhere else if you are replicating your show folder to the cloud or if your show folder is on a smallish SSD drive. Both folders can get stupid large over time if you dont manage them.</p>
        <p>I personally leave my sequence files in the show folder itself. Some folks like to create a folder per sequence or just a sequences folder. If you are going to go that route please ensure you turn on backup subdirectories otherwise you may not be getting the backups you expect. If you go this way you are also likely to want to put the assets used by each sequence into subfolders of the sequence folder.</p>
