        <h1>Export Model Data</h1>
        <p>If you right click on the model name in the sequencer tab you can export the model data to a number of file formats used by other sequencers and players.</p>
        <p>One of these formats is video which exports the data in same resolution as the model so they are not all that useful except for playing back on other models in xlights or even in lor. It is a much better way to get large model effects into lor than exporting to the clipboard. It is also commonly used to share tree/matrix effects in xLighs as the video effect scales more true to its original look that some of the underlying effects.</p>
        <p>While you are there you can also create eseq files which can be used by fpp or xschedule as a background sequence for things like tune to signs.</p>
