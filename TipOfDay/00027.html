        <h1>Documenting your show</h1>
        <p>Much of what people have historically kept spreadsheets to document about their displays may not be required when you use xLights.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Tools/Export Models menu item exports all of your model/controller data into a Excel Spreadsheet(.xlsx) file - for those times when you really need to see all your controller and model configuration in a simple list.</li>
            <li>The Tools/Export Controller Connection menu item will create a controller "hookup" list with a printout of all your controllers and what models are attached to each port.</li>
            <li>The Controller and Model description fields allow you to capture ad-hoc data about your models that you otherwise wouldn't put in xLights.</li>
            <li>In the visualiser you can right click and print the controller setup.</li>
            <li>The controller connection field can also be used - even when you decide not to take advantage of controller uploads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do still use spreadsheets we are keen to understand what additional data you capture outside of xLights as we would like to allow you to consolidate it in one place.</p>
