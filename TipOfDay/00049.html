        <h1>Triac failures</h1>
        <p>If you are using a LOR controller and xSchedule and you suffer a triac failure and need to move some lights from one output to another ... you can quickly remap the channel in xSchedule and save yourself from having to change and rerender all your sequences.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the edit menu in xSchedule and select Output Processing.</li>
            <li>Add a remap item.</li>
            <li>Enter the absolute channel to map from and to and write yourself a note so you will remember later what you did and why you did it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now when sequences are played data destined for the dead channel are seamlessly copied to the new channel.</p>
        <p>There is a similar feature available in FPP.</p>
