        <h1>Single Screen Sequencing</h1>
        <p>Sequencing on a single screen computer can be a real challenge in xLights ... there are so many things you want on the screen at the same time.</p>
        <p>This is where the play controls on the House Preview window and the auto show/hide of the house preview can really help.</p>
        <p>In the program preferences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>View | Auto Show House Preview</i> - when selected the house preview will automatically appear whenever you start playing a sequence ... and when you stop it ... it disappears again so you can get back to sequencing.</li>
            <li><i>View | Play Controls On Preview</i> - when selected and the house preview isn’t docked and it is a reasonable size a toolbar appears at the bottom of the house preview that lets you control the playback. Used in combination with the Auto show feature this can let you make your house preview full screen even on a single screen computer.</li>
            <li><i>View | Tool Icon Size</i> - Setting this to small will make your icons small and take up less space.</li>
            <li><i>Effects Grid | Spacing</i> - Setting this to extra small will compress the model rows in the sequencer.</li>
            <li><i>Effects Grid | Small Waveform</i> - Selecting this option will shrink the waveform size.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As a bonus tip ... when dragging windows and you don’t want them to dock ... try holding down the control key as you let go of the mouse button ... this suppresses the windows natural desire to dock.</p>
