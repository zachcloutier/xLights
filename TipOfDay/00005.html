        <h1>Export Preview Video</h1>
        <p>To export a video of your show for posting on social media.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Load your sequence and render it.</li>
            <li>Make the house preview window as large as you want the video resolution to be ... typically full screen.</li>
            <li>On the "File" menu select "Export House Preview Video".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your lights seem too small or washed out in the video consider making the pixel sizes larger. You can do this in bulk on the layout tab by clicking in the layout, pressing ctrl-A and then right clicking selecting "Bulk Edit" and then "Pixel Size". Default for pixels is size 2 so making them a bit larger will likely make them look bigger in the video.</p>
