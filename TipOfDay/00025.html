        <h1>Exporting presets</h1>
        <p>When exporting presets did you know that you can export multiple presets in a single xpreset file. Just organise them in a group and then select the group before you press the export button.</p>
        <p>When the preset is imported it will create a group with all the presets in it.</p>
        <p>As a bonus if you have groups in groups it is still true when you do the export the whole tree is placed into the xpreset file.</p>
