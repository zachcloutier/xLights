        <h1>Sorting models in views</h1>
        <p>To quickly sort models in views open the display elements panel, select the view you want to sort and the right click on the list of models in the view and select one of the sort options.</p>
        <p>In the master view I would generally recommend the "By Name but Groups at Top by Size" order. By using this layout when you sequence on groups and then specific models it is more likely the more specific elements sequencing will take priority over the more generic groups containing more models.</p>
