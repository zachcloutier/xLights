        <h1>Resetting xLights to new install state</h1>
        <p>To reset xlights and xschedule to their fresh installed condition don't uninstall and reinstall ... instead run them with the /w command line switch. How you do that is slightly different on each operating system.</p>
        <p>On windows open up a command prompt and typically type the following.</p>
        <code>"c:\program files\xlights\xlights.exe" /w</code>
