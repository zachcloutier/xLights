        <h1>Logs</h1>
        <p>When things are not working right don't be scared to take a look in the logs (tools menu view logs). Go to the bottom of the file and search for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>[crit</b> - these are either crashes or messages indicating we are about to crash. Not much you can do here. As long as you sent us the crash report we are on it.</li>
            <li><b>[err</b> - something is seriously wrong. Most of the time you would have seen an error message but sometimes that is just not possible so we write them to the log so we can look good when you ask us what is wrong.</li>
            <li><b>[warn</b> - something is not quite right. Most commonly this is slow rendering but sometimes it is other things. Worth looking at just in case it explains something that doesn't seem quite right.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Everything else are just progress/informational messages that we use to understand what is going on when you report a problem or the program crashes.</p>
        </p>Note: include the <b>[</b> in the search as otherwise you will find a bunch of lines which are not actually worth looking at.</p>
