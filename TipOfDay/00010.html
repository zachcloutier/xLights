        <h1>xScanner</h1>
        <p>There are times when you may need to scan your network to identify controllers.</p>
        <p>In the past to do this common tools used were Advanced IP Scanner and Angry IP Scanner. These tools are really good at finding the IP addresses of devices on your network but they know little about those devices.</p>
        <p>To address this we created xScanner which is available on the tools menu.</p>
        <p>xScanner also scans your network but rather than just using generic network methods to scan for devices xScanner has built in awareness of the protocols and technologies commonly used in the lighting hobby. This allows xScanner to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the configuration in xLights to identify likely devices and then go looking for them even if they are on remote networks.</li>
            <li>Use controller discovery protocols to identify local devices.</li>
            <li>Use knowledge of FPP to scan through the FPP proxy configuration.</li>
            <li>Capture important configuration information about the devices found due to knowledge of the controllers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A further benefit is xScanner scans all available networks rather than just one ... so even if you have multiple networks or devices spread across multiple networks xScanner will likely find them in one scan.</p>
