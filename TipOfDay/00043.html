        <h1>Locking models and effects</h1>
        <p>Because a lot of the editing in xLights is drag and drop this occasionally leads to making accidental changes when you are editing your layout or sequence.</p>
        <p>For this reason in the layout and the sequencer we allow you to lock your models and effects. Doing so prevents them from being moved on the screen and deleted but does not prevent you making other property changes.</p>
        <p>In both instances you can lock and unlock by using the right click menu. This also works after selecting multiple models/effects so to lock everything press ctrl-A and then do the lock or unlock.</p>
        <p>Render Cache has a mode which recognises locked effects and only caches those. This makes sense because locked effects are generally much less likely to change and thus gain more from render caching.</p>
