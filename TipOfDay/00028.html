        <h1>Easter Eggs</h1>
        <p>xSchedule has 2 Easter Eggs in it in the form of games. To access them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You need a matrix or tree that is at least 20 pixels high and 10 wide - anything less and it just wont work.</li>
            <li>You need to setup xSchedule - at least enough to play the game.</li>
            <li>You need to describe your tree/matrix in xSchedule ... see the Edit/Matrix menu option ,,, these settings are very similar to the ones you use in xLights. If you have a 360 tree you may want to only include the front part of the tree when you define your matrix.</li>
            <li>You need to access the xSchedule web page ... ideally from a phone but you can also do it on your computer.</li>
            <li>You need to click on the blue version text at the bottom of the page to launch the easer egg ... there are actually 2 links here. Each one takes you to a different game.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Have fun and don't forget to post a video of your game play ... and maybe a high score.</p>
