        <h1>Go early or go late</h1>
        <p>Because of the fixed time slices in xLights sequences the perfect place for a timing mark is often in the middle of an indivisible time frame. So you are left with the decision of do i go slightly early or do i go slightly late? Is there a right answer?</p>
        <p>You should always go early ... for two reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The human brain is wired to expect visual data to arrive marginally before audio data just because light travels faster than sound. So our brains dont see it as odd.</li>
            <li>There is a much bigger lag in light output. The audio plays and xLights asks the audio player where it is up to in the song. Based on that it reads the light data, puts it into network packets, sends those network packets to a controller which reassembles that data and converts it into pixel data and sends it out. All of that takes time. So you may as well get a head start on the lighting data as going late is going to look even worse.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Same goes for lyrics. If the word starts in the middle of a time slice always start the word before not after it actually starts.</p>
