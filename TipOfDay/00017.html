        <h1>Rendering text across matrix groups</h1>
        <p>Using the text effect on groups of say matrices or trees will rarely give you what you expected.</p>
        <p>The reason this happens is because when the render buffer is created for a group we look at your positioning of your model on the screen and overlay a matrix - this doesn't generate the same tight matrix buffer layout that a matrix or tree normally does.</p>
        <p>The best solution is to use a render buffer style of "Horizontal Stacked".</p>
