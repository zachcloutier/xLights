        <h1>xSchedule Show Folder</h1>
        <p>Pay attention to the colour of your show folder name at the bottom left of the schedule window.</p>
        <p>If it is red xschedule can't find your xlights_networks.xml file which it needs to know where to send the data to. This should be in your xlights show folder. When in this state xSchedule cannot control any lights.</p>
        <p>If it is amber it means that when you last ran xlights on this machine you had it pointed at a different show folder to the one you have xschedule pointed at. This may be intentional or it may just explain why your lights look different under xlights and xschedule.</p>
        <p>If it is black then it is the same of xLights and is almost certainly set correctly.</p>
        <p>As ever run check schedule to get this all explained.</p>
