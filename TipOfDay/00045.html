        <h1>Package sequence</h1>
        <p>If you want to share a sequence with someone always use the tools menu package sequence method as this guarantees the package will include all the source files necessary to reproduce your sequence regardless of where on the computer they happen to be.</p>
        <p>When using such a sequence there are some key things you need to do to ensure it works correctly and continues to work correctly once imported:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Either import the sequence directly from the zip file which ensures all file linkages are perfect but has the downside of cluttering up your folders and it makes it hard to review the sequence you are importing.</li>
            <li>Or extract the zip file but:
                <ol>
                    <li>Extract the zip file into a sub folder of your show folder.</li>
                    <li>Temporarily switch your show folder to the  folder you extracted the sequence into.</li>
                    <li>Check the layout is the layout you should be importing from.</li>
                    <li>Load the sequence.</li>
                    <li>Render the sequence and play it to check it all looks ok.</li>
                    <li><b>Save the sequence</b> - This is super super critical as it fixes all the file paths ready for the import.</li>
                    <li>Switch back to your show folder,</li>
                    <li>Import the sequence from the folder you extracted it into.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If sharing publicly you will want to exclude the audio file for copyright reasons. There is a setting option to do that. You may also want to exclude your presets while you are at it.</p>
