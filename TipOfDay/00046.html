        <h1>Custom model numbering</h1>
        <p>When creating a custom model and entering the model data for a pixel model always start the node numbering at 1 and then increment from there.</p>
        <p>While uncommon it is not illegal to skip numbers such as a model where you leave some pixels behind the coro to avoid needing to cut and splice for larger jumps. If you do this check sequence will however warn you that you are missing nodes in your model. Another example of it is ok to ignore warnings in check sequence if you did something uncommon on purpose.</p>
