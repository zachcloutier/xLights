        <h1>VUMeter cryptic names</h1>
        <p>VU Meter has lots of inbuilt types with cryptic names - so here is your decoding guide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Triggers:
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Timing Event</i> - These types require you to select a timing track. At the start/end of every timing interval the VU meter will trigger and take an action.</li>
                    <li><i>Level</i> - These types use the sensitivity setting as a level (0-100) - when the audio crosses from below that level to over that level the VU meter will trigger and take an action</li>
                    <li><i>Note</i> - Allows you to filter the range of notes the VU meter is sensitive to.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Actions:
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Bar</i> - When the trigger occurs a bar will be drawn that then moves across the element typically from right to left. The size of the bar is controlled by the bars setting.</li>
                    <li><i>Pulse</i> - When the trigger occurs the lights will pulse on and then fade based on the bars setting.</li>
                    <li><i>Color</i> - When the trigger occurs it will cycle to the next selected colour</li>
                    <li><i>Jump</i> - When the trigger occurs the effect will fill the element vertically and then drop away based on the bars setting</li>
                    <li><i>Shape</i> - Displays a shape proportional to the music intensity. Play with sensitivity to control how big the shape is relative to the audio</li>
                    <li><i>On</i> - Turns on the LEDs proportional to the music intensity</li>
                    <li><i>Sweep</i> - Sweep across the model</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
