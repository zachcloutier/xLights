        <h1>Useful definitions: <i>String, Strand and Node</i></h1>
        <p>When setting model properties you will see properties relating to the number of strings, nodes per string and strands per string.</p>
        <p>A node in most cases is a single LED/RGB pixel but in some cases nodes may have more than one LED or RGB light connected to a single chip. In this case all LEDs are controlled as one and thus this is considered a single node.</p>
        <p>A string represents a set of nodes connected together. They start at a controller or receiver and they end connected to nothing.</p>
        <p>On some models such as trees and matrices you may want to zig zag a single string up and down or across and back the model. In this case each zig or zag is known as a strand.</p>
