        <h1>Check Sequence</h1>
        <p>Tools menu / check sequence is the first thing all xLights users should master. It embodies expert knowledge of a whole bunch of things you can do which generate odd or just plain broken results.</p>
        <p>If check sequence says you have an error it just plain won't work ... fix it.</p>
        <p>If check sequence says you have a warning ... then it's more complicated. If you did what you did on purpose and you know why you did it then it is ok ... we flag warnings when something is uncommon or can have unexpected results if not used correctly. Striving for zero warnings is not necessary. Striving for zero warnings you can't clearly explain why you created is advisable.</p>
