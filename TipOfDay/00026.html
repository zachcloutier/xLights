        <h1>Submodel generation</h1>
        <p>On top of the ability create intricate custom submodels by selecting which pixels to include ... sometimes you just need to break a model up into vertical or horizontal slices ... and that is where the generate button on the submodel dialog comes into its own. Just specify how many slices you want, which way you want to slice it, give the submodel a base name (it will tag on a number to make the names unique) and boom your model has several submodels that you can easily drop effects onto.</p>
        <p>Why fiddle with morph settings when you can just do full sweeps on submodels.</p>
