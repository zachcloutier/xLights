        <h1>Effect Times</h1>
        <p>When sequencing obviously you can zoom right in to check is two effects start at the same time or are the same length but you don't need to do all that zooming.</p>
        <p>When you move the mouse over an effect it's start time, end time, duration and type are displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the sequencer window.</p>
