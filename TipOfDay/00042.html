        <h1>Reporting Bugs</h1>
        <p>All software has bugs and in something as complex as xLights there is no shortage of them.</p>
        <p>We always appreciate users reporting bugs but doing it the right way can make a big difference to how quickly it is fixed or if it is even fixed at all.</p>
        <p>Here are some things to check before you head over to Github to report your bug:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run check sequence and deal with errors and review the warnings. Check sequence is incredibly thorough and has the accumulated knowledge of hundreds of hours of troubleshooting.</li>
            <li>Are you using the latest version. Bugs are both created and fixed all the time ... if you cannot reproduce it in the latest version then likely it has already been fixed and re-raising a bug on an old version just creates wasted effort looking for something that isnt there.</li>
            <li>Be sure it really is a bug. Can someone else also reproduce it or can you reproduce it on a second machine. Doing this check will help eliminate environmental issues such as video drivers and other common causes.</li>
            <li>Depending on your level of expertise running the bug past someone with more experience might help validate the bug you are raising. Lots of users do this by popping into the Zoom room (see the help menu) and speaking to the other hobbiests there. This really helps resolve a lot of bugs that are not really bugs.</li>
            <li>Once you are sure it is a bug including all the files necessary to reproduce the problem is key. No matter how simple you think it is to reproduce the bug attaching a sequence or layout that shows the bug (and ideally only the bug ... ie dont send a full sequence when just one effect would do). This allows us to rapidly validate the bug is there and makes it many times more likely that it will be fixed.</li>
            <li>Consider adding a screen recording with commentary showing the bug ... particularly if reproducing the bug has several steps. Deciphering a description of several steps is unreliable. Watching a video of you reproducing the problem while telling us what you are doing is so much easier to follow.</li>
            <li>Once reported Github will typically email you if we comment on your bug report or ask for more information. Please be as responsive as you can be in getting back to us on these things. If you wont be able to respond within 48 hours let us know so we dont get left hanging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Emailing or messaging specific developers is generally not the best way to get bugs addressed. Mainly because it then is all on that one developer. If you report it on Github then any one of several developers can take a look and try to fix it often leading to a much faster resolution.</p>
