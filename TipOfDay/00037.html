        <h1>Bulk Editing Effects</h1>
        <p>Sometimes when building a sequence, you may decide to change various settings of an effect, or an image on your matrix. That's usually easy enough, but let's say you have decided to change every image on your matrix, or every color on your house outline. That's where bulk edit is your friend.</p>
        <p>Bulk edit can be performed on almost any effects in your sequence, but you first need to select several effects in your sequence, and there are a couple of ways to do this.</p>
		<ul>
		<li> Drag a box around the effects that you would like to bulk edit. (This only works when all timing tracks are currently turned off.)</li>
		<li> Click one effect, hold control (command on a mac) and click every other effect that you woul like to bulk edit.</li>
		<li> If bulk editing a specific model only, right click the model in the sequencer and choose either model, or row. (Model being every effect on that model, row being only effects on that row.)</li>
        <li> If you need to bulk edit a specific effect within the entire sequence, you can use the <b>SELECT EFFECTS</b> window by going to <B>VIEW&gt;WINDOWS&gt;SELECT EFFECTS.</B> This window allows you to choose a single effect throughout your entire sequence to edit at one time. In this window, first choose the effect, then choose one, or several models, you can even choose all models if you need to, then choose one or more time slots that you would like to change.</li>
		</ul>
        <p> Once you have selected the effects that you want to bulk edit, you can <b> RIGHT CLICK</b> on the setting that you would like to bulk edit for those effects (for example, color or render style) and choose bulk edit, then change that setting on all of those effects. Keep in mind that almost any setting can be bulk edited with a simple right click of the setting that you want to change.</p>
		<br>
		<p> There are exceptions however, for example, bulk editing the fade in/ fade out transition will require you to change the the timing on the fade in/ fade out transition before you right click on the drop down arrow to bulk edit.</p>
        <p> The bottom line is, bulk edit is your friend, don't be afraid to <b>RIGHT CLICK</b> if you need to change multiple effects.</p>
