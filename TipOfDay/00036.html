        <h1>Wiring View</h1>
        <p>Matching the way you wire your models to the way xlights sees the models is critical to getting everything to look right.</p>
        <p>That is where the wiring view comes in. Just right click on the model in your layout and select wiring view to get an idea of how the pixels should be laid out.</p>
        <p>By default the wiring view shows the model from behind. The reason this is done is because most coro props involve the pushing of pixels from behind the prop and as such it makes more sense to see the behind view. To flip to the front use the right click menu.</p>
        <p>To save the image or print it just right click on the wiring image. You likely will want to set it to black on white first to save some printer ink.</p>
        <p>Note: some models do not support a wiring view. For example dmx and block of channels.</p>
